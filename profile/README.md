## üõ†Ô∏è Our Projects  

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been building to push the boundaries of NLP:

---

### **[SelfAttention](https://github.com/evNLP/SelfAttention)**  
Step into the world of **Transformers** and unlock the power of **self-attention mechanisms**. This repository is your playground for understanding and implementing the building blocks of modern NLP.  
**Why You‚Äôll Love It**:
- Build Transformer self-attention layers from scratch in PyTorch.  
- Explore examples for tasks like summarization, text classification, and translation.  
- Use this as a foundation to create models like BERT or GPT.

---

### **[LstmAttention](https://github.com/evNLP/LstmAttention)**  
Combine the simplicity of **LSTMs** with the precision of **attention mechanisms**. This repo is perfect for tackling sequence tasks like machine translation with added focus on the most important input features.  
**Why You‚Äôll Love It**:
- Implement attention over LSTMs to highlight key text elements.  
- Optimize translation workflows for tasks like English-to-Spanish models.  
- PyTorch examples included to get you started in no time.

---

### **[Instruct](https://github.com/evNLP/Instruct)**  
Adapt pre-trained models like GPT-2 to your specific tasks with ease. Whether it‚Äôs generating creative content or refining a chatbot, this repo has you covered.  
**Why You‚Äôll Love It**:
- Scripts for fine-tuning GPT-2 on custom datasets.  
- Step-by-step examples for text generation, classification, and more.  
- Designed for developers who want to squeeze more out of their language models.

---

### **[TextClassification](https://github.com/evNLP/TextClassification)**  
From traditional methods to deep learning, this repository covers it all for **text classification**. Ideal for building sentiment analysis pipelines, category classifiers, and more.  
**Why You‚Äôll Love It**:
- Compare Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and neural networks.  
- Build projects in both PyTorch and sklearn.  
- Hands-on examples for real-world applications.

---

### **[Glove](https://github.com/evNLP/Glove)**  
Take your NLP to the next level with **GloVe embeddings**. Represent words in rich vector spaces that capture their context and relationships.  
**Why You‚Äôll Love It**:
- Integrate GloVe embeddings into LSTM-based models or classifiers.  
- Pre-trained embeddings ready to supercharge sentiment analysis and more.  
- Clear PyTorch examples to make implementation seamless.

---

### **[BoW](https://github.com/evNLP/bow)**  
Turn words into numbers with the **Bag of Words (BOW)** approach. Perfect for quick prototyping and lightweight classification tasks.  
**Why You‚Äôll Love It**:
- Generate BOW matrices from any text corpus.  
- Compare documents using similarity metrics like cosine distance.  
- Great for classification, retrieval, and simple text analysis.
